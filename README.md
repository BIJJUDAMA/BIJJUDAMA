#  Hello there! I'm Nitansh Shankar

I'm an full-stack developer passionate about building complete, user-centric web applications from the ground up. I enjoy working across the entire development lifecycle, from designing interactive frontends to engineering robust, scalable backends.
I build clear, reliable, and user-friendly web applications. Currently expanding into AI/ML, I combine full-stack engineering with AI/ML to create smarter digital experiences.

My projects reflect my passion for creating engaging digital experiences, whether it's a modern social platform for artists or a classic game brought to life with code.
