# 👋 Hello there! I'm Nitansh Shankar

I'm an aspiring full-stack developer passionate about building complete, user-centric web applications from the ground up. I enjoy working across the entire development lifecycle, from designing interactive frontends to engineering robust, scalable backends.

My projects reflect my passion for creating engaging digital experiences, whether it's a modern social platform for artists or a classic game brought to life with code.

### 🚀 What I Do

I specialize in bringing ideas to life by working across the entire stack. I'm comfortable building with modern JavaScript frameworks like **React** alongside powerful serverless backends like **Supabase**, as well as crafting applications with traditional, robust frameworks like **Django**.

- 💻 **Frontend:** I focus on creating fast, responsive, and intuitive user interfaces using **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS/Bootstrap CSS**. I love adding a layer of polish with animations using tools like **Framer Motion/Animate.css**.
- 🛠️ **Backend:** I have experience building secure and scalable backend systems, handling everything from user authentication and database management (**MySQL**,**Supabase**,**Firebase**) to API logic.
- 🎨 **Full-Stack Integration:** I excel at connecting the frontend and backend seamlessly to create full-featured applications with features like user profiles, admin dashboards, and dynamic content.
